Blood Cell Subtypes Classification
Introduction
Medical Image Analysis is a widely used method to screen and diagnose diseases. Depending of the part or tissue of the body would check, we can subset imaging Technics into 2 big methods. First the methods that use rays, like x-ray, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) or Scintigraphy. In general, the images generated by these methods are as a photographic film (black and white). The advantage of these methods is that we can observe body through tissues and have access to internal parts without chirurgy. The inconvenient is that these methods uses ionizing radiation (dangerous for health) and mainly expensive. There are at less two kaggle competition with this type of images: NIH Chest X-rays and Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) The second kind of medical imaging is applied to all type of tissues or physiological fluid (plasma, blood). The samples are prepared on glass slide and stained with Hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E). This technique is very old and widely used for several medical screening and diagnostics. H&E staining is not expensive but needs Human intervention and the processing takes a while. The interpretation of the images also needs multiple experts (pathologist) to visualize and diagnose slides mainly through microscopes. the analysis remains subjective and could differ between pathologists.

On the other hand, the H&E stains are routinely prepared by technicians who become overwhelmed by the increasing number of samples. Likewise, pathologists are over-worked by the microscopic observation and interpretation, causing overflow that may result in diagnostic error.

**#Motivation**

A computational grading of slides using learning machine may help to make a pre-screening a hundred or thousand or slides before Human verification.

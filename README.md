# Models

Here implemented two models using various classification techniques.

**1. Blood Cell Classification**

In this problem I classified the blood cell subtypes using dataset https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/blood-cells.
In this classification problem Convolution Neural Network approach is implemented. 

**2. Multiclass classification of Dry Beans**

In this problem I classified the Dry Bean types using dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00602/.

In this classification problem various approach is implemented like RandomForestClassifier, Decision Tree, XGBClassifier, Support Vector Machine, Multilayer perceptron.
